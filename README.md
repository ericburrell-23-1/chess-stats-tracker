# Chess-Stats-Tracker

## Description

This is a project that uses a postgreSQL database to store data from a user's chess.com account by accessing the chess.com API, and retrieve that data to analyze games. It will allow the user to see macroscopic trends of their performance. More features be added to allow for in-depth analysis.

## Tech

The point of this project besides being functional is to learn new skills and refresh myself on existing tech. The data is stored in a postgreSQL database; the server uses Flask and is written in Python; the client uses React.
